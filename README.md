# Harriulator

This calculator app was orginially an end-of-course project on the React Basic course on Meta Front-End Developer Certificate course provided by Coursera.

It was created using the react-app npm package for creating boiler-plate React apps, and so still contains all of the buit-in files in the public, node-modules folder and root folder. The only modified files are the App.js and App.css files in the src folder. Every other critical app file was untouched.

I added better styling and aesthetics by modifying the default App.css file originally provided for the project.

It is still subject to updates and ongoing modifictaions as you might have noticed from the commented code in the App.js file.

I hope you like it!
